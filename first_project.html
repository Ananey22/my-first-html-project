                        <p><b>Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming languages.</b>
                        <ul style="color: black">
                            <li>Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years.</li>
                            <li>Java is Object Oriented. However, it is not considered as pure object-oriented as it
                                provides support for primitive data types (like int, char, etc)</li>
                            <li>The Java codes are first compiled into byte code (machine-independent code). Then the
                                byte code runs on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.
                            </li>
                            <li>Java syntax is similar to C/C++. But Java does not provide low-level programming
                                functionalities like pointers. Also, Java codes are always written in the form of
                                classes and objects.</li>
                            <li>Java is used in all kinds of applications like Mobile Applications (Android is
                                Java-based), desktop applications, web applications, client-server applications,
                                enterprise applications, and many more.</li>
                            <li>When compared with C++, Java codes are generally more maintainable because Java does not
                                allow many things which may lead to bad/inefficient programming if used incorrectly. For
                                example, non-primitives are always references in Java. So we cannot pass large objects
                                (like we can do in C++) to functions, we always pass references in Java. One more
                                example, since there are no pointers, bad memory access is also not possible.</li>
                            <li>When compared with Python, Java kind of fits between C++ and Python. The programs are
                                written in Java typically run faster than corresponding Python programs and slower than
                                C++. Like C++, Java does static type checking, but Python does not.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <article>
                        <p><b>The complete History of Java Programming Language:</b></p>
                        <p>Java is an Object-Oriented programming language developed by James Gosling in the early
                            1990s.
                            The team initiated this project to develop a language for digital devices such as set-top
                            boxes, television, etc.
                            Originally C++ was considered to be used in the project but the idea was rejected for
                            several reasons(For instance C++ required more memory).
                            Gosling endeavoured to alter and expand C++ however before long surrendered that for making
                            another stage called Green.
                            James Gosling and his team called their project “Greentalk” and its file extension was .gt
                            and later became to known as “OAK”.
                            Why “Oak”? The name Oak was used by Gosling after an oak tree that remained outside his
                            office.
                            Also, Oak is an image of solidarity and picked as a national tree of numerous nations like
                            the U.S.A., France, Germany, Romania, etc.
                            But they had to later rename it as “JAVA” as it was already a trademark by Oak Technologies.
                            “JAVA” Gosling and his team did a brainstorm session and after the session, they came up
                            with several names such as JAVA, DNA, SILK, RUBY, etc.
                            Java name was decided after much discussion since it was so unique. The name Java originates
                            from a sort of espresso bean, Java.
                            Gosling came up with this name while having a coffee near his office.
                            Java was created on the principles like Robust, Portable, Platform Independent, High
                            Performance, Multithread, etc. and was called one of the Ten Best Products of 1995 by the
                            TIME MAGAZINE.
                            Currently, Java is used in internet programming, mobile devices, games, e-business
                            solutions, etc.
                            The Java language has experienced a few changes since JDK 1.0 just as various augmentations
                            of classes and packages to the standard library.
                            In Addition to the language changes, considerably more sensational changes have been made to
                            the Java Class Library throughout the years,
                            which has developed from a couple of hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to more than three thousand
                            in J2SE</p>

                        <p><b>Some interesting facts that all programmers should know about Java</b></p>
                        <ul style="color: black">
                            <li>Java was invented by accident. James Gosling was working at Sun Labs, around 1992.
                                Gosling and his team were building a set-top box and started by “cleaning up” C++ and
                                wound up with a new language and runtime. Thus Java or Oak came into being</li>
                            <li>95 percent of enterprises use Java for programming. That is hell lot more than C and
                                other languages put together.</li>
                            <li>Java practically runs on 1billion plus smartphones today because Google’s Android
                                operating system uses Java APIs.</li>
                            <li>The original name for Java was Oak. Java legend has it that a big oak tree that grew
                                outside the developer James Gosling’s window.</li>
